@article{Rakshit2017,
abstract = {Noisy optimization is currently receiving increasing popularity for its widespread applications in engineering optimization problems, where the objective functions are often found to be contaminated with noisy sensory measurements. In absence of knowledge of the noise-statistics, discriminating better trial solutions from the rest becomes difficult in the “selection” step of an evolutionary optimization algorithm with noisy objective/s. This paper provides a thorough survey of the present state-of-the-art research on noisy evolutionary algorithms for both single and multi-objective optimization problems. This is undertaken by incorporating one or more of the five strategies in traditional evolutionary algorithms. The strategies include (i) fitness sampling of individual trial solution, (ii) fitness estimation of noisy samples, (iii) dynamic population sizing over the generations, (iv) adaptation of the evolutionary search strategy, and (v) modification in the selection strategy.},

@article{Siegmund2013,
abstract = {In Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization many solutions have to be evaluated to provide the decision maker with a diverse choice of solutions along the Pareto-front, in particular for high-dimensional optimization problems. In Simulation-based Optimization the modeled systems are complex and require long simulation times. In addition the evaluated systems are often stochastic and reliable quality assessment of system configurations by resampling requires many simulation runs. As a countermeasure for the required high number of simulation runs caused by multiple optimization objectives the optimization can be focused on interesting parts of the Pareto-front, as it is done by the Reference point-guided NSGA-II algorithm (R-NSGA-II) [9]. The number of evaluations needed for the resampling of solutions can be reduced by intelligent resampling algorithms that allocate just as much sampling budget needed in different situations during the optimization run. In this paper we propose and compare resampling algorithms that support the R-NSGA-II algorithm on optimization problems with stochastic evaluation functions. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

@article{DiPietro2004,
abstract = {For many "real world" applications of evolutionary computation, the fitness function is obscured by random noise. This interferes with the evaluation and selection process and adversely affects the performance of the algorithm. We present a study of noise compensation techniques designed to better counteract the negative effects of noise. We introduce algorithms that vary the number of samples used per candidate based on the amount of noise present at that point in the search space. Results show that these algorithms are significantly better than the traditional technique used by the optimisation community and that noise compensation is indeed a difficult task that warrants further investigation.},

@article{Arslan2015,
abstract = {Recently many application are migrated towards cloud computing. It becomes an emerging field of research in software testing; moreover it is non-trivial to evaluate the performance of cloud services. Performance and load testing are one of the dominant means to evaluate the web-application performance. At the end of load testing performance analyst have to analyze thousands of performance counters in both scenarios traditional as well as in cloud based load testing. These performance counters consist of run time system and web application properties such as resource consumption, response time, Memory utilization, throughput, Disk input output, latency, network traffic, delay. Performance analyst analyzes these performance measures manually, find out if the application meets service level agreement or not. It is very time consuming and error prone method, so to resolve this issue in this paper we proposed an approach to detect the performance deviation in cloud based load testing compare with the traditional load testing. It also helps performance analyst to compare load test more efficiently in order to detect performance deviation moreover it provides manageable set of important program counter to analyst for further and efficient root cause analysis. This approach is verified on the data obtain by performing load testing of web-application using J-meter in case of traditional and blaze meter in cloud based load testing. Our proposed approach provide up to 90{\%} of reduction in the set of performance counter and 96{\%} precision while detecting performance deviation with few false positives.},

abstract = {Cloud platform provides an infrastructure for resource sharing, software hosting and service delivering in a pay-per-use approach. To test the cloud-based software systems, techniques and tools are necessary to address unique quality concerns of the cloud infrastructure such as massive scalability and dynamic configuration. The tools can also be built on the cloud platform to benefit from virtualized platform and services, massive resources, and parallelized execution. The paper makes a survey of representative approaches and typical tools for cloud testing. It identifies the needs for cloud testing tools including multi-layer testing, SLA-based testing, large scale simulation, and on-demand test environment. To address the needs, it investigates the new architecture and techniques for designing testing tools for the cloud and in the cloud. Tool implementations are surveyed considering different approaches including migrated conventional tools, research tools, commercial tools and facilities like benchmark and testbed. Based on the analysis of state-of-the-art practices, the paper further investigates future trend of testing tool research and development from both capability and usability perspectives.},

abstract = {The objective of this report is to propose comprehensive guidelines for systematic literature reviews appropriate for software engineering researchers, including PhD students. A systematic literature review is a means of evaluating and interpreting all available research relevant to a particular research question, topic area, or phenomenon of interest. Systematic reviews aim to present a fair evaluation of a research topic by using a trustworthy, rigorous, and auditable methodology. The guidelines presented in this report were derived from three existing guidelines used by medical researchers, two books produced by researchers with social science backgrounds and discussions with researchers from other disciplines who are involved in evidence-based practice. The guidelines have been adapted to reflect the specific problems of software engineering research. The guidelines cover three phases of a systematic literature review: planning the review, conducting the review and reporting the review. They provide a relatively high level description. They do not consider the impact of the research questions on the review procedures, nor do they specify in detail the mechanisms needed to perform meta-analysis.},

While the theoretical complexity of such a method is lower bounded by the complexity of the partition, which is, in the worst-case, larger than the best upper bound on the complexity of the hypervolume computation, we show that it is practically efficient. In particular, the nonincremental algorithm competes with the currently most practically efficient algorithms. Finally, we prove an enhanced upper bound of .

@book{Marinescu2015,
abstract = {Software testing aims at gaining confidence in software products through fault detection, by observing the differences between the behavior of the implementation and the expected behavior described in the specification. Nowadays, testing is the main verification technique used in industry, being a time and resource consuming activity. This has boosted the development of potentially more efficient testing techniques, like model-based testing, where test creation and execution can be automated, using an abstract system model as input. In this chapter, we provide an overview of the state-of-the-art in tool-supported model-based testing that starts from requirements-based models, by presenting and classifying some of the most mature tools available at this moment. Our goal is to get a deeper insight into the state-of-the-art in this area, as well as to form a position with respect to possible needs and gaps in the current tools used by industry and academia, which need to be addressed in order to enhance the applicability of model-based testing techniques. To achieve this, we extend an existing taxonomy with: (i) the test artifact, representing the type of information encoded in the model for the purpose of testing (i.e., functional behavior, extra-functional behavior, or the architectural description), and (ii) the mapping of test cases, which describes ways of using the generated test cases on the actual system under test. To provide further evidence of the inner-workings of different model-based testing tools, we select four representative tools (i.e, ProTest, UPPAAL Cover, MaTeLo, and CompleteTest) that we apply on a simple yet illustrative Coffee/Tea Vending Machine example, to show the differences in modeling notations, test case generation methods, and the produced test-cases. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Zitzler2001,
abstract = {The Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm(SPEA) (Zitzler and Thiele 1999) is a relatively recent technique for finding or approximating the Pareto-optimal set for multiobjective optimization problems. In different studies (Zitzler and Thiele 1999; Zitzler, Deb, and Thiele 2000) SPEA has shown very good performance in comparison to other multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, and therefore it has been a point of reference in various recent investigations, e.g., (Corne, Knowles, and Oates 2000). Furthermore, it has been used in different applications, e.g., (Lahanas, Milickovic, Baltas, and Zamboglou 2001). In this paper, an improved ver- sion, namely SPEA2, is proposed, which incorporates in contrast to its predecessor a fine-grained fitness assignment strategy, a density estimation technique, and an enhanced archive truncation method. The comparison of SPEA2 with SPEA and two other modern elitist methods, PESA and NSGA-II, on different test problems yields promising results. 1},

Our approach uses n-dimensional polynomial models as an algorithmically learned abstraction of the SUT which supports n-wise testing. Test cases are iteratively generated by applying a satisfiability algorithm to first-order program specifications over real closed fields and iteratively refined piecewise polynomial models. We benchmark the performance of our iterative ATCG algorithm against iterative random testing, and empirically analyse its performance in finding injected errors in numerical codes. Our results show that for software with small errors, or long mean time to failure, learning-based testing is increasingly more efficient than iterative random testing. {\textcopyright} 2010 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

@inproceedings{Kamali2007,
abstract = {In traditional optimal control and design problems, the control gains and design parameters are usually derived to minimize a cost function reflecting the system performance and control effort. One major challenge of such approaches is the selection of weighting matrices in the cost function, which are usually determined via trial-and-error and human intuition. While various techniques have been proposed to automate the weight selection process, they either can not address complex design problems or suffer from slow convergence rate and high computational costs. We propose a layered approach based on Q-learning, a reinforcement learning technique, on top of genetic algorithms (GA) to determine the best weightings for optimal control and design problems. The layered approach allows for reuse of knowledge. Knowledge obtained via Q-learning in a design problem can be used to speed up the convergence rate of a similar design problem. Moreover, the layered approach allows for solving optimizations that cannot be solved by GA alone. To test the proposed method, we perform numerical experiments on a sample active-passive hybrid vibration control problem, namely adaptive structures with active-passive hybrid piezoelectric networks. These numerical experiments show that the proposed Q-learning scheme is a promising approach for automation of weight selection for complex design problems. (27 References).},

It is not surprising that many methods for solving problems in Artificial Intelligence, Operations Research and related areas, follow the search scheme [...] We aim at giving the main principles and at developing some fresh intuition for the approaches. We like mathematics but we also think that hiding the underlying motivations and sources of inspiration takes some color out of the scientific work [...]. On the other hand, pictures and hand-waving can be very dangerous in isolation and we try to avoid these pitfalls by giving also the basic equations when possible, or by at least directing the reader to the bibliographic references for deepening a topic.

@inproceedings{Bennett2006,
abstract = {The fields of machine learning and mathematical programming are increasingly intertwined. Optimization problems lie at the heart of most machine learning approaches. The Special Topic on Machine Learning and Large Scale Optimization examines this interplay. Machine learning researchers have embraced the advances in mathematical programming allowing new types of models to be pursued. The special topic includes models using quadratic, linear, second-order cone, semi-definite, and semi-infinite programs. We observe that the qualities of good optimization algorithms from the machine learning and optimization perspectives can be quite different. Mathematical programming puts a premium on accuracy, speed, and robustness. Since generalization is the bottom line in machine learning and training is normally done off-line, accuracy and small speed improvements are of little concern in machine learning. Machine learning prefers simpler algorithms that work in reasonable computational time for specific classes of problems. Reducing machine learning problems to well-explored mathematical programming classes with robust general purpose optimization codes allows machine learning researchers to rapidly develop new techniques. In turn, machine learning presents new challenges to mathematical programming. The special issue include papers from two primary themes: novel machine learning models and novel optimization approaches for existing models. Many papers blend both themes, making small changes in the underlying core mathematical program that enable the develop of effective new algorithms.},

Despite all efforts, software engineers cannot fully prevent performance problems being introduced into an application. Detecting and resolving such problems as early as possible with minimal effort is still an open challenge in software performance engineering. In this paper, we present a novel approach for Performance Problem Diagnostics (PPD) that systematically searches for well-known performance problems (also called performance antipatterns) within an application. PPD automatically isolates the problem's root cause, hence facilitating problem solving. We applied PPD to a well established transactional web e-Commerce benchmark (TPC-W) in two deployment scenarios. PPD automatically identified four performance problems in the benchmark implementation and its deployment environment. By fixing the problems, we increased the maximum throughput of the benchmark from 1800 requests per second to more than 3500.},

abstract = {Performance problems such as high response times in software applications have a significant effect on the customer's satisfaction. In enterprise applications, performance problems are frequently manifested in inefficient or unnecessary communication patterns between software components originating from poor architectural design or implementation. Due to high manual effort, thorough performance analysis is often neglected, in practice. In order to overcome this problem, automated engineering approaches are required for the detection of performance problems. In this paper, we introduce several heuristics for measurement-based detection of well-known performance anti-patterns in inter-component communications. The detection heuristics comprise load and instrumentation descriptions for performance tests as well as corresponding detection rules. We integrate these heuristics with Dynamic Spotter, a framework for automatic detection of performance problems. We evaluate our heuristics on four evaluation scenarios based on an e-commerce benchmark (TPC-W) where the heuristics detect the expected communication performance anti-patterns and pinpoint their root causes.

abstract = {Identifying and removing the causes of poor performance in software systems are complex problems due to a variety of factors to take into account. Nowadays these problems are usually tackled after the software deployment only with human-based means, which frequently boil down to developer skills and previous experiences. Performance antipatterns can be used to cope with these problems since they capture typical design patterns that are known leading to performance problems, as well as refactoring actions that can be taken to remove them. The goal of this paper is to introduce an approach that allows the refactoring of architectural models, based on antipatterns, that aims at providing performance improvement. To this end, we use a Role-Based Modeling Language to represent: (i) antipattern problems as Source Role Models (SRMs), and (ii) antipattern solutions as Target Role Models (TRMs). Hence, SRM-TRM pairs represent new instruments in the hands of developers to achieve architectural model refactorings aimed at removing sources of performance problems. Model refactoring for antipattern removal can be in fact obtained by replacing an SRM with the corresponding TRM. This approach has been applied to a case study in the e-commerce domain, whose experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2012 ACM.},

	Abstract = {Safety-critical Real Time Embedded Systems (RT-ESs) are usually subject to strict timing and performance requirements that must be satisfied for the system to be deemed safe. In this paper, we use effective search strategies whose goal is finding worst case scenarios with respect to deadline misses. Such scenarios can in turn be used to test the target RTES and ensure that it satisfies its timing requirements even under worst case conditions. Specifically, we develop an approach based on Constraint Programming (CP) to automate the generation of test cases that reveal, or are likely to, task deadline misses. We evaluate it through a comparison with a state-of-the-art approach based on Genetic Algorithms (GA). In particular, we compare CP and GA in five case studies for efficiency, effectiveness, and scalability. Our experimental results show that, on the largest and more complex case studies, CP performs significantly better than GA. Furthermore, CP offers some advantages over GA, such as it guarantees a complete search when there is sufficient time, and, being deterministic, it doesn't rely on parameters that potentially have a significant effect on the search and therefore need to be tuned. Hence, we conclude that our results are encouraging and suggest this is an advantageous approach for stress testing of RTESs with respect to timing constraints.},

	Abstract = {Whereas the verification of non-safety-related embedded software typically focuses on demonstrating that the implementation fulfills its functional requirements, this is not sufficient for safety-relevant systems. In this case, the control software must also meet application- specific safety requirements.Safety requirements typically arise from the application of hazard and/or safety analysis techniques, e.g., FMEA, FTA or SHARD. During the downstream development process it must be shown that these requirements cannot be violated. This can be achieved utilizing different techniques. One way of providing evidence that violations of the safety properties identified cannot occur is to thoroughly test each of the safety requirements.This paper introduces Evolutionary Safety Testing (EST), a fully automated procedure for the safety testing of embedded control software. EST employs extended evolutionary algorithms in an optimization process which aggressively tries to find test data sequences that cause the test object to violate a given safety requirement.A compact description formalism for input sequences for safety testing is presented, which is compatible with description techniques used during other test process stages. This compact description allows 1) an efficient application of evolutionary algorithms (and other optimization techniques) and 2) the description of long test sequences necessary for the adequate stimulation of real-world systems. The objective function is designed in such a way that optimal values represent test data sequences which violate a given safety requirement. By means of repeated input sequence generation, software execution and the subsequent evaluation of the objective function each safety requirement is extensively tested.The use of EST for the safety testing of automotive control software is demonstrated using safety requirements of an adaptive cruise control (ACC) system.The EST approach can easily be integrated into an overall software test strategy which combines different test design techniques with specific test objectives.},

	Abstract = {Software architecture design approaches typically treat architecture as an abstraction of the implemented system. However, doing so means that the concepts, languages, notations, and tools for architecture are much more closely related to those of detailed design and implementation than to those of software requirements. Thus the gap between requirements and architecture represents a paradigm shift, while that between architecture and detailed design does not. Global Analysis, which is part of the Siemens Four Views architecture design approach, is a set of activities that serves to reduce the magnitude of this gap by guiding the architecture design process, capturing design rationale, and supporting traceability between requirements and architecture. In this paper Global Analysis is re-examined in light of five years of teaching it, reflecting on it, comparing it to other approaches, and examining how it was applied in four new systems. This experience confirms the value of the Global Analysis activities and the importance of capturing its results. In some cases the benefit went beyond that envisioned, and in other cases Global Analysis was not applied as expected. Because the templates that are provided for Global Analysis results have such a strong influence on how the activities were performed, this will be the focus of future changes},

	Abstract = {Research in metaheuristics for combinatorial optimization problems has lately experienced a noteworthy shift towards the hybridization of metaheuristics with other techniques for optimization. At the same time, the focus of research has changed from being rather algorithm-oriented to being more problem-oriented. Nowadays the focus is on solving the problem at hand in the best way possible, rather than promoting a certain metaheuristic. This has led to an enormously fruitful cross-fertilization of different areas of optimization. This cross-fertilization is documented by a multitude of powerful hybrid algorithms that were obtained by combining components from several different optimization techniques. Hereby, hybridization is not restricted to the combination of different metaheuristics but includes, for example, the combination of exact algorithms and metaheuristics. In this work we provide a survey of some of the most important lines of hybridization. The literature review is accompanied by the presentation of illustrative examples. {\copyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {The goal of a load test is to uncover functional and per- formance problems of a system under load. Performance problems refer to the situations where a system suffers from unexpectedly high response time or low throughput. It is difficult to detect performance problems in a load test due to the absence of formally-defined performance objectives and the large amount of data that must be examined. In this paper, we present an approach which automati- cally analyzes the execution logs of a load test for perfor- mance problems. We first derive the system's performance baseline from previous runs. Then we perform an in-depth performance comparison against the derived performance baseline. Case studies show that our approach produces few false alarms (with a precision of 77\%) and scales well to large industrial systems.},

	Abstract = {Search-based software testing is the application of metaheuristic search techniques to generate software tests. The test adequacy criterion is transformed into a fitness function and a set of solutions in the search space are evaluated with respect to the fitness function using a metaheuristic search technique. The application of metaheuristic search techniques for testing is promising due to the fact that exhaustive testing is infeasible considering the size and complexity of software under test. Search-based software testing has been applied across the spectrum of test case design methods; this includes white-box (structural), black-box (functional) and grey-box (combination of structural and functional) testing. In addition, metaheuristic search techniques have also been applied to test non-functional properties. The overall objective of undertaking this systematic review is to examine existing work into non-functional search-based software testing (NFSBST). We are interested in types of non-functional testing targeted using metaheuristic search techniques, different fitness functions used in different types of search-based non-functional testing and challenges in the application of these techniques. The systematic review is based on a comprehensive set of 35 articles obtained after a multi-stage selection process and have been published in the time span 1996-2007. The results of the review show that metaheuristic search techniques have been applied for non-functional testing of execution time, quality of service, security, usability and safety. A variety of metaheuristic search techniques are found to be applicable for non-functional testing including simulated annealing, tabu search, genetic algorithms, ant colony methods, grammatical evolution, genetic programming (and its variants including linear genetic programming) and swarm intelligence methods. The review reports on different fitness functions used to guide the search for each of the categories of execution time, safety, usability, quality of service and security; along with a discussion of possible challenges in the application of metaheuristic search techniques. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {The development of real-time systems is an essential industrial activity whose importance is increasing. The most important analytical method to assure the quality of real-time systems is dynamic testing. Testing is the only method which examines the actual run-time behaviour of real-time software, based on an execution in the real application environment. Dynamic aspects like the duration of computations, the memory actually needed, or the synchronization of parallel processes are of major importance for the correct function of real-time systems and have to be tested. A comprehensive investigation of existing software test methods shows that they mostly concentrate on testing for functional correctness. They are not suited for an examination of temporal correctness which is essential to real-time systems. Very small systems show a wide range of different execution times. Therefore, existing test procedures must be supplemented by new methods, which concentrate on determining whether the system violates its specified timing constraints. In general, this means that outputs are produced too early or their computation takes too long. The task of the tester is to find the inputs with the longest or shortest execution times to check whether they produce a temporal error. If the search for such inputs is interpreted as a problem of optimization, genetic algorithms can be used to find the inputs with the longest or shortest execution times automatically. The fitness function is the execution time measured in processor cycles. Experiments using genetic algorithms on a number of programs with up to 1511 LOC and 843 integer input parameters have successfully identified new longer and shorter paths than had been found using random testing or systematic testing. Genetic algorithms are able therefore to check large programs and they show considerable promise in establishing the validity of the temporal behaviour of real-time software.},

The idea is to produce test cases in order to find problematic situations like processing time extremes. The proposed test method comes under the heading of automated dynamic stress testing. Keywords: genetic algorithms, software engineering, dynamic stress testing 1 Introduction Real-time software is increasingly applied to products in which failure may have severe consequences, thus the requirements for correctness and reliability are getting higher, too. In very reliable sequential programs, the rate of errors should be less than 10 errors/1000 lines of code, to avoid functional failure. Achieving this level is very labourious, because the amount of program testing work grows exponentially with code size. Testing software manually is slow, expensive and demands inventiveness. Automated testing can reduce both the time and costs needed for performing tests. Exhaustive test data generation is...},

Software design is considered from a wide viewpoint, including topics that can also be categorized as software maintenance or re-engineering. Search-based approaches have been used in research from the high architecture design level to software clustering and finally software refactoring. Enhancing and predicting software quality with search-based methods is also taken into account as a part of the design process. The background for the underlying software engineering problems is discussed, after which search-based approaches are presented. Summarizing remarks and tables collecting the fundamental issues of approaches for each type of problem are given. The choices regarding critical decisions, such as representation and fitness function, when used in meta-heuristic search algorithms, are emphasized and discussed in detail.

The goal of the work is to develop and evaluate tools for offline and online analysis of system metrics gathered from instrumentation in Internet server platforms. We use a promising class of probabilistic models (Tree-Augmented Bayesian Networks or TANs) to identify combinations of system-level metrics and threshold values that correlate with high-level with Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for average-case response timein a three-tier Web service under a variety of conditions. Experimental results from a testbed show that TAN models involving small subsets of metrics capture patterns of performance behavior in a way that is accurate and yields insights into the causes of observed performance effects. TANs are extremely efficient to represent and evaluate, and they have interpretability properties that make them excellent candidates for automated diagnosis and control. We explore the use of TAN models for offline forensic diagnosis, and in a limited online setting for performance forecasting with stable workloads.},

intervention is one key to this large system's reliability. Software is
not the weak link in the PSTN system's dependability. Extensive use of
built-in self-test and recovery mechanisms in major system components
(switches) contributed to software dependability and are significant
design features in the PSTN. The network's high dependability indicates
that the trade-off between dependability gains and complexity introduced
by built-in self-test and recovery mechanisms can be positive. Likewise,
the tradeoff between complex interactions and the loose coupling of
system components has been positive, permitting quick human intervention

The problem consists of automatically creating a set of input data to test a program. This is a fundamental step in software development and a time consuming task in existing software companies. Canonical sequential EAs have been used in the past for this task. We explore here the use of parallel EAs. Evidence of greater efficiency, larger diversity maintenance, additional availability of memory/CPU, and multi-solution capabilities of the parallel approach, reinforce the importance of the advances in research with these algorithms. We describe in this work how canonical genetic algorithms (GAs) and evolutionary strategies (ESs) can help in software testing, and what the advantages are (if any) of using decentralized populations in these techniques. In addition, we study the influence of some parameters of the proposed test data generator in the results. For the experiments we use a large benchmark composed of twelve programs that includes fundamental algorithms in computer science. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

However, despite the large number of recent studies on the applicability of different search-based optimization approaches, there has been very little theoretical analysis of the types of testing problem for which these techniques are well suited. There are also few empirical studies that present results for larger programs. This paper presents a theoretical exploration of the most widely studied approach, the global search technique embodied by Genetic Algorithms. It also presents results from a large empirical study that compares the behavior of both global and local search-based optimization on real-world programs. The results of this study reveal that cases exist of test data generation problem that suit each algorithm, thereby suggesting that a hybrid global-local search (a Memetic Algorithm) may be appropriate. The paper presents a Memetic Algorithm along with further empirical results studying its performance.},

abstract = {The specification of workloads is required in order to evaluate performance characteristics of application systems using load testing and model-based performance prediction. Defining workload specifications that represent the real workload as accurately as possible is one of the biggest challenges in both areas. To overcome this challenge, this paper presents an approach that aims to automate the extraction and transformation of workload specifications for load testing and model-based performance prediction of session-based application systems. The approach (WESSBAS) comprises three main components. First, a system- and tool-agnostic domain-specific language (DSL) allows the layered modeling of workload specifications of session-based systems. Second, instances of this DSL are automatically extracted from recorded session logs of production systems. Third, these instances are transformed into executable workload specifications of load generation tools and model-based performance evaluation tools. We present transformations to the common load testing tool Apache JMeter and to the Palladio Component Model. Our approach is evaluated using the industry-standard benchmark SPECjEnterprise2010 and the World Cup 1998 access logs. Workload-specific characteristics (e.g., session lengths and arrival rates) and performance characteristics (e.g., response times and CPU utilizations) show that the extracted workloads match the measured workloads with high accuracy.},

Further, the predictions may have long term effects through influencing the future state of the controlled system. Thus, time plays a special role. The goal in reinforcement learning is to develop efficient learning algorithms, as well as to understand the al- gorithms' merits and limitations. Reinforcement learning is of great interest because of the large number of practical applications that it can be used to address, ranging from problems in artificial intelligence to operations research or control engineering. In this book,we focus on those algorithms of reinforcement learning that build on the powerful theory of dynamic programming.We give a fairly comprehensive catalog of learning problems, describe the core ideas, note a large number of state of the art algorithms, followed by the discussion of their theoretical properties and limitations.},

A fundamental question of performance testing is how to select a manageable subset of the input data faster in order to automatically find performance bottlenecks in applications. We propose FOREPOST, a novel solution, for automatically finding performance bottlenecks in applications using black-box software testing. Our solution is an adaptive, feedback-directed learning testing system that learns rules from execution traces of applications. Theses rules are then used to automatically select test input data for performance testing. We hypothesize that FOREPOST can find more performance bottlenecks as compared to random testing. We have implemented our solution and applied it to a medium-size industrial application at a major insurance company and to two open-source applications. Performance bottlenecks were found automatically and confirmed by experienced testers and developers. We also thoroughly studied the factors (or independent variables) that impact the results of FOREPOST. {\&}copy; 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York},

	Abstract = {This is the second half of a two part series devoted to the tabu search metastrategy for optimization problems. Part I introduced the fundamental ideas of tabu search as an approach for guiding other heuristics to overcome the limitations of local optimality, both in a deterministic and a probabilistic framework. Part I also reported successful applications from a wide range of settings, in which tabu search frequently made it possible to obtain higher quality solutions than previously obtained with competing strategies, generally with less computational effort. Part II, in this issue, examines refinements and more advanced aspects of tabu search. Following a brief review of notation, Part II introduces new dynamic strategies for managing tabu lists, allowing fuller exploitation of underlying evaluation functions. In turn, the elements of staged search and structured move sets are characterized, which bear on the issue of finiteness. Three ways of applying tabu search to the solution of integer programming problems are then described, providing connections also to certain nonlinear programming applications. Finally, the paper concludes with a brief survey of new applications of tabu search that have occurred since the developments reported in Part I. Together with additional comparisons with other methods on a wide body of problems, these include results of parallel processing implementations and the use of tabu search in settings ranging from telecommunications to neural networks.},

testing is an iterative testing procedure, which approximates the
extreme execution times within several generations. By executing the
test object dynamically and measuring the execution times the inputs are
guided yielding gradually tighter predictions of the extreme execution

	Abstract = {Many industrial products are based on the use of embedded computer systems. Usually, these systems have to fulfil real-time requirements, and correct system functionality depends on their logical correctness as well as on their temporal correctness. in order to verify the temporal behavior of real-time systems, previous scientific work has, to a large extent, concentrated on static analysis techniques. Although these techniques offer the possibility of providing safe estimates of temporal behavior for certain cases, there are a number of cases in practice for which static analysis can not be easily applied. Furthermore, no commercial tools for timing analysis of real-world programs are available. Therefore, the developed systems have to be thoroughly tested in order to detect existing deficiencies in temporal behavior, as well as to strengthen the confidence in temporal correctness. An investigation of existing test methods shows that they mostly concentrate on testing for logical correctness. They are nor specialised in the examination of temporal correctness which is also essential to real-rime systems. For this reason, existing test procedures must be supplemented by new methods which concentrate on determining whether the system violates its specified timing constraints. Normally, a violation means that outputs are produced too early, or their computation takes too long. The task of the tester therefore is to find the input situations with the longest or shortest execution limes, in order to check whether they produce a temporal error. If the starch for such inputs is interpreted as a problem of optimization, evolutionary computation can be used to automatically find the inputs with the longest or shortest execution rimes. This automatic search for accurate test data by means of evolutionary computation is called evolutionary testing. Experiments using evolutionary testing on a number of programs with up to 1511 LOC and 5000 input parameters have successfully identified new longer and shorter execution times than had been found using other testing techniques. Evolutionary testing, therefore, seems to be a promising approach for the verification of timing constraints. A combination of evolutionary testing and systematic testing offers further opportunities to improve the test quality, and could lead to an effective test strategy for real-time systems.},

abstract = {The complexity of modern computer systems makes performance modeling an invaluable resource for guiding crucial decisions such as workload management, conﬁguration management, and resource provisioning. With continually evolving systems, it is diﬃcult to obtain ground truth about system behavior. Moreover, system management policies must adapt to changes in workload and conﬁguration to continue making eﬃcient decisions. Thus, we require data-driven modeling techniques that auto-extract relationships between a system's input workload, its conﬁguration parameters, and consequent performance. This dissertation argues that statistical machine learning (SML) techniques are a powerful asset to system performance modeling. We present an SML-based methodology that extracts correlations between a workload's pre-execution characteristics or conﬁguration parameters, and post-execution performance observations. We leverage these correlations for performance prediction and optimization. We present three success stories that validate the usefulness of our methodology on storage and compute based parallel systems. In all three scenarios, we outperform state of the art alternatives. Our results strongly suggest the use of SML-based performance modeling to improve the quality of system management decisions.},

Analyzing and modeling performance demands knowledge of performance experts and analysts. In order to integrate performance analysis into software analysis and design methods, performance-specific properties known as domain knowledge have to be identified, analyzed, and documented properly. In this paper, we propose the performance analysis method PoPeRA to guide the requirements engineer in dealing with performance problems as early as possible in requirements analysis. Our structured method provides support for identifying potential performance problems using performance-specific domain knowledge attached to the requirement models. To deal with identified performance problems, we make use of performance analysis patterns to be applied to the requirement models in the requirements engineering phase. To show the application of our approach, we illustrate it with the case study CoCoME, a trading system to be deployed in supermarkets for handling sales.},

@article{Aguilera2003,
abstract = {Many interesting large-scale systems are distributed systems of multiple communicating components. Such systems can be very hard to debug, especially when they exhibit poor performance. The problem becomes much harder when systems are composed of "black-box" components: software from many different (perhaps competing) vendors, usually without source code available. Typical solutions-provider employees are not always skilled or experienced enough to debug these systems efficiently. Our goal is to design tools that enable modestly-skilled programmers (and experts, too) to isolate performance bottlenecks in distributed systems composed of black-box nodes.We approach this problem by obtaining message-level traces of system activity, as passively as possible and without any knowledge of node internals or message semantics. We have developed two very different algorithms for inferring the dominant causal paths through a distributed system from these traces. One uses timing information from RPC messages to infer inter-call causality; the other uses signal-processing techniques. Our algorithms can ascribe delay to specific nodes on specific causal paths. Unlike previous approaches to similar problems, our approach requires no modifications to applications, middleware, or messages.},

@book{Oliner2011,
abstract = {This thesis is concerned with understanding the behavior of complex systems, particularly in the common case where instrumentation data is noisy or incomplete. We begin with an empirical study of logs from production systems, which characterizes the content of those logs and the challenges associated with analyzing them automatically, and present an algorithm for identifying surprising messages in such logs. The principal contribution is a method, called influence, that identifies relationships among components---even when the underlying mechanism of interaction is unknown---by looking for correlated surprise. Two components are said to share an influence if they tend to exhibit surprising behavior that is correlated in time. We represent the behavior of components as surprise (deviation from typical or expected behavior) over time and use signal-processing techniques to find correlations. The method makes few assumptions about the underlying systems or the data they generate, so it is applicable to a variety of unmodified production systems, including supercomputers, clusters, and autonomous vehicles. We then extend the idea of influence by presenting a query language and online implementation, which allow the method to scale to systems with hundreds of thousands of signals. In collaboration with system administrators, we applied these tools to real systems and discovered correlated problems, failure cascades, skewed clocks, and performance bugs. According to the administrators, it also generated information useful for diagnosing and fixing these issues.},

@article{Fritzsche2007,
abstract = {The increase in the use of parallel distributed architectures in order to solve large-scale scientific problems has generated the need for performance prediction for both deterministic applications and non-deterministic applications. The development of a new prediction methodology to estimate the execution time of a hard data-dependent parallel application that solves the traveling salesman problem (TSP) is the primary target of this study. The prediction methodology is an analytical process designed to explore a group of cities in search of patterns and/or relationships between these cities, and then to validate performance prediction for new cities sets by applying the detected patterns. The TSP problem is of considerable importance not only from a theoretical point of view. There are important cases of practical problems that can be formulated as TSP problems and many other problems are generalizations of this problem. Therefore, there is a tremendous need for TSP algorithms and still more for knowing their performance values. Three different parallel algorithms of the Euclidean TSP are used to apply the proposed methodology. The experimental results are quite promising; the capacity of prediction is greater than 75{\%}.},

The problem becomes challenging when the objectives are of conflict to each other, that is, the optimal solution of an objective function is different from that of the other. In solving such problems, with or without the presence of constraints, these problems give rise to a set of trade-off opti- mal solutions, popularly known as Pareto-optimal solutions. Due to the multiplicity in solutions, these problems were proposed to be solved suitably using evolutionary algorithms which use a population ap- proach in its search procedure.

abstract = {Online services such as search and live applications rely on large infrastructures in data centers, consisting of both stateless servers (e.g., web servers) and stateful servers (e.g., database servers). Acceptable performance of such infrastructures, and hence the availability of online services, rely on a very large number of parameters such as per-process resources and configurable system/application parameters. These parameters are available for collection as performance counters distributed across various machines, but services have had a hard time determining which performance counters to monitor and what thresholds to use for performance alarms in a production environment. In this paper, we present a novel framework called PerfAnalyzer, a storage-efficient and pro-active performance monitoring framework for correlating service health with performance counters. PerfAnalyzer automatically infers and builds health models for any service by running the standard suite of predeployment tests for the service and data mining the resulting performance counter data-set. A filtered set of performance counters and thresholds of alarms are produced by our framework. The health model inferred by our framework can then be used to detect performance degradation and collect detailed data for root-cause analysis in a production environment. We have applied PerfAnalyzer on five simple stress scenarios - CPU, memory, I/O, disk, and network, and two real system - Microsoft's SQL Server 2005 and IIS 7.0 Web Server, with promising results.},

We describe how to use that information to isolate the cause of observed instability and how to structure load tests to identify scenarios in which system instability is likely to occur. We discuss resilience assessment based on performance measurements. Specifically, we present our experience generating load tests and analyzing the performance testing results. We discuss how we have used these results for security, reliability and performance assessment. We discuss the conditions required for system stability and identify some of the causes for system instability, such as security attacks, quality problems, and queuing for system resources. We present a metric that can be used to assess some dimensions of system security, reliability and performance using data obtained from the execution of performance testing. In addition, we present the associated testing activities that are required to collect data for the required modeling and analysis activities, and to help track system security, reliability and performance.

Users save the cost of complicated maintenance and upgrade effort, and service providers can upgrade their services without impact on the end-users. Due to uneven volumes of concurrent requests, it is important to address the elasticity of TaaS platform in a cloud environment. Scheduling and dispatching algorithms are developed to improve the utilization of computing resources. We develop a prototype of TaaS over cloud, and evaluate the scalability of the platform by increasing the test task load, analyze the distribution of computing time on test task scheduling and test task processing over the cloud, and examine the performance of proposed algorithms by comparing others.},

abstract = {Accurate web application performance testing relies on the use of loading tests based on a realistic client behaviour load model. Unfortunately developing such load models and associated test plans and scripts is tedious and error-prone with most existing web performance testing tools providing limited client load modelling capabilities. We describe a new approach and toolset that we have developed, MaramaMTE+, which improves the ability to model realistic web client load behaviour, automatically generates complex web application testing plans and scripts, and integrates load behaviour modelling with a generic performance engineering tool. MaramaMTE+ uses a stochastic form chart as its client loading model. A 3rd party web crawler application extracts structural information from a target web site, aggregating the collected data into a crawler database that is then used for form chart model generation. The performance engineer then augments this synthesized form probabilities. Realistic web loading tests for a 3rd party web load testing tool are then automatically generated from this resultant stochastic form chart client load model. We chart with client loading describe the development of our MaramaMTE+ environment, example usage of the tool, and compare and contrast the results obtained from our generated performance load tests against hand-built 3rd party tool load tests.},

@article{Zhang2011,
abstract = {Load tests aim to validate whether system performance is acceptable under peak conditions. Existing test generation techniques induce load by increasing the size or rate of the input. Ignoring the particular input values, however, may lead to test suites that grossly mischaracterize a system's performance. To address this limitation we introduce a mixed symbolic execution based approach that is unique in how it 1) favors program paths associated with a performance measure of interest, 2) operates in an iterative-deepening beam-search fashion to discard paths that are unlikely to lead to high-load tests, and 3) generates a test suite of a given size and level of diversity. An assessment of the approach shows it generates test suites that induce program response times and memory consumption several times worse than the compared alternatives, it scales to large and complex inputs, and it exposes a diversity of resource consuming program behavior.},

The basic principle embodied in the framework is to use performance analysis tools to capture the runtime behaviour of a program as it executes each test in a regression suite. The performance information is then used to build a dynamically predictive model of test outcomes. Our framework is evaluated using a genetic algorithm for dynamic metric selection in combination with state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers. We show that if a program is modified and some tests subsequently fail, then it is possible to predict with considerable accuracy which of the remaining tests will also fail which can be used to help prioritise tests in time constrained testing environments.},

abstract = {We present an application of learning-based testing to the problem of automated test case generation (ATCG) for numerical software. Our approach uses n-dimensional polynomial models as an algorithmically learned abstraction of the SUT which supports n-wise testing. Test cases are iteratively generated by applying a satisfiability algorithm to first-order program specifications over real closed fields and iteratively refined piecewise polynomial models. We benchmark the performance of our iterative ATCG algorithm against iterative random testing, and empirically analyse its performance in finding injected errors in numerical codes. Our results show that for software with small errors, or long mean time to failure, learning-based testing is increasingly more efficient than iterative random testing. {\textcopyright} 2010 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

@article{Kamali2007,
abstract = {In traditional optimal control and design problems, the control gains and design parameters are usually derived to minimize a cost function reflecting the system performance and control effort. One major challenge of such approaches is the selection of weighting matrices in the cost function, which are usually determined via trial-and-error and human intuition. While various techniques have been proposed to automate the weight selection process, they either can not address complex design problems or suffer from slow convergence rate and high computational costs. We propose a layered approach based on Q-learning, a reinforcement learning technique, on top of genetic algorithms (GA) to determine the best weightings for optimal control and design problems. The layered approach allows for reuse of knowledge. Knowledge obtained via Q-learning in a design problem can be used to speed up the convergence rate of a similar design problem. Moreover, the layered approach allows for solving optimizations that cannot be solved by GA alone. To test the proposed method, we perform numerical experiments on a sample active-passive hybrid vibration control problem, namely adaptive structures with active-passive hybrid piezoelectric networks. These numerical experiments show that the proposed Q-learning scheme is a promising approach for automation of weight selection for complex design problems. (27 References).},

Learning takes places when the problem at hand is not well known at the beginning, and its structure becomes more and more clear when more experience with the problem is available. [...] What is critical for men is critical also in many human-developed problem solving strategies. It is not surprising that many methods for solving problems in Artificial Intelligence, Operations Research and related areas, follow the search scheme [...] We aim at giving the main principles and at developing some fresh intuition for the approaches. We like mathematics but we also think that hiding the underlying motivations and sources of inspiration takes some color out of the scientific work [...]. On the other hand, pictures and hand-waving can be very dangerous in isolation and we try to avoid these pitfalls by giving also the basic equations when possible, or by at least directing the reader to the bibliographic references for deepening a topic. The point of view of the book is to look at the zoo of different optimization beasts to underline opportunities for learning and self-tuning strategies.},

@article{Bennett2006,
abstract = {The fields of machine learning and mathematical programming are increasingly intertwined. Optimization problems lie at the heart of most machine learning approaches. The Special Topic on Machine Learning and Large Scale Optimization examines this interplay. Machine learning researchers have embraced the advances in mathematical programming allowing new types of models to be pursued. The special topic includes models using quadratic, linear, second-order cone, semi-definite, and semi-infinite programs. We observe that the qualities of good optimization algorithms from the machine learning and optimization perspectives can be quite different. Mathematical programming puts a premium on accuracy, speed, and robustness. Since generalization is the bottom line in machine learning and training is normally done off-line, accuracy and small speed improvements are of little concern in machine learning. Machine learning prefers simpler algorithms that work in reasonable computational time for specific classes of problems. Reducing machine learning problems to well-explored mathematical programming classes with robust general purpose optimization codes allows machine learning researchers to rapidly develop new techniques. In turn, machine learning presents new challenges to mathematical programming. The special issue include papers from two primary themes: novel machine learning models and novel optimization approaches for existing models. Many papers blend both themes, making small changes in the underlying core mathematical program that enable the develop of effective new algorithms.},

Despite all efforts, software engineers cannot fully prevent performance problems being introduced into an application. Detecting and resolving such problems as early as possible with minimal effort is still an open challenge in software performance engineering. In this paper, we present a novel approach for Performance Problem Diagnostics (PPD) that systematically searches for well-known performance problems (also called performance antipatterns) within an application. PPD automatically isolates the problem's root cause, hence facilitating problem solving. We applied PPD to a well established transactional web e-Commerce benchmark (TPC-W) in two deployment scenarios. PPD automatically identified four performance problems in the benchmark implementation and its deployment environment. By fixing the problems, we increased the maximum throughput of the benchmark from 1800 requests per second to more than 3500.},

abstract = {Performance problems such as high response times in software applications have a significant effect on the customer's satisfaction. In enterprise applications, performance problems are frequently manifested in inefficient or unnecessary communication patterns between software components originating from poor architectural design or implementation. Due to high manual effort, thorough performance analysis is often neglected, in practice. In order to overcome this problem, automated engineering approaches are required for the detection of performance problems. In this paper, we introduce several heuristics for measurement-based detection of well-known performance anti-patterns in inter-component communications. The detection heuristics comprise load and instrumentation descriptions for performance tests as well as corresponding detection rules. We integrate these heuristics with Dynamic Spotter, a framework for automatic detection of performance problems. We evaluate our heuristics on four evaluation scenarios based on an e-commerce benchmark (TPC-W) where the heuristics detect the expected communication performance anti-patterns and pinpoint their root causes.

abstract = {Identifying and removing the causes of poor performance in software systems are complex problems due to a variety of factors to take into account. Nowadays these problems are usually tackled after the software deployment only with human-based means, which frequently boil down to developer skills and previous experiences. Performance antipatterns can be used to cope with these problems since they capture typical design patterns that are known leading to performance problems, as well as refactoring actions that can be taken to remove them. The goal of this paper is to introduce an approach that allows the refactoring of architectural models, based on antipatterns, that aims at providing performance improvement. To this end, we use a Role-Based Modeling Language to represent: (i) antipattern problems as Source Role Models (SRMs), and (ii) antipattern solutions as Target Role Models (TRMs). Hence, SRM-TRM pairs represent new instruments in the hands of developers to achieve architectural model refactorings aimed at removing sources of performance problems. Model refactoring for antipattern removal can be in fact obtained by replacing an SRM with the corresponding TRM. This approach has been applied to a case study in the e-commerce domain, whose experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2012 ACM.},

	Abstract = {Real-Time Embedded Systems (RTES) in safety-critical domains, such as maritime and energy, must satisfy strict performance requirements to be deemed safe. Therefore, such systems have to be thoroughly tested to ensure their correct behavior even under the worst operating conditions. In this paper, we address the need of deriving worst case scenarios with respect to three common performance requirements, namely task deadlines, response time, and CPU usage. Specifically, we investigate whether this worst-case analysis can be effectively re-expressed as a Constrained Optimization Problem (COP) over the space of possible inputs to the system. Solving this problem means finding the sets of inputs that maximize the chance to violate performance requirements at runtime. Such inputs can in turn be used to test if the target RTES meets the expected performance even in the worst case. We develop an OPL model for IBM ILOG CP Optimizer that implements a task priority-based preemptive scheduling, and apply it to a case study from the maritime and energy domain. Our validation shows that (1) the input to our model can be provided with reasonable effort in an industrial setting, and (2) the COP effectively identifies test cases that maximize deadline misses, response time, and CPU usage.},

In this paper, we use effective search strategies whose goal is finding worst case scenarios with respect to deadline misses. Such scenarios can in turn be used to test the target RTES and ensure that it satisfies its timing requirements even under worst case conditions. Specifically, we develop an approach based on Constraint Programming (CP) to automate the generation of test cases that reveal, or are likely to, task deadline misses. We evaluate it through a comparison with a state-of-the-art approach based on Genetic Algorithms (GA). In particular, we compare CP and GA in five case studies for efficiency, effectiveness, and scalability. Our experimental results show that, on the largest and more complex case studies, CP performs significantly better than GA. Furthermore, CP offers some advantages over GA, such as it guarantees a complete search when there is sufficient time, and, being deterministic, it doesn't rely on parameters that potentially have a significant effect on the search and therefore need to be tuned. Hence, we conclude that our results are encouraging and suggest this is an advantageous approach for stress testing of RTESs with respect to timing constraints.},

	Abstract = {Manifold possibilities of hybridizing individual metaheuristics with each other and/or with algorithms from other fields exist. A large number of publications documents the benefits and great success of such hybrids. This article overviews several popular hybridization approaches and classifies them based on various characteristics. In particular with respect to low-level hybrids of different metaheuristics, a unified view based on a common pool template is described. It helps in making similarities and different key components of existing metaheuristics explicit. We then consider these key components as a toolbox for building new, effective hybrid metaheuristics. This approach of thinking seems to be superior to sticking too strongly to the philosophies and historical backgrounds behind the different metaheuristic paradigms. Finally, particularly promising possibilities of combining metaheuristics with constraint programming and integer programming techniques are highlighted.},

@article{Pohlheim2005,
	Abstract = {Whereas the verification of non-safety-related embedded software typically focuses on demonstrating that the implementation fulfills its functional requirements, this is not sufficient for safety-relevant systems. In this case, the control software must also meet application- specific safety requirements.Safety requirements typically arise from the application of hazard and/or safety analysis techniques, e.g., FMEA, FTA or SHARD. During the downstream development process it must be shown that these requirements cannot be violated. This can be achieved utilizing different techniques. One way of providing evidence that violations of the safety properties identified cannot occur is to thoroughly test each of the safety requirements.This paper introduces Evolutionary Safety Testing (EST), a fully automated procedure for the safety testing of embedded control software. EST employs extended evolutionary algorithms in an optimization process which aggressively tries to find test data sequences that cause the test object to violate a given safety requirement.A compact description formalism for input sequences for safety testing is presented, which is compatible with description techniques used during other test process stages. This compact description allows 1) an efficient application of evolutionary algorithms (and other optimization techniques) and 2) the description of long test sequences necessary for the adequate stimulation of real-world systems. The objective function is designed in such a way that optimal values represent test data sequences which violate a given safety requirement. By means of repeated input sequence generation, software execution and the subsequent evaluation of the objective function each safety requirement is extensively tested.The use of EST for the safety testing of automotive control software is demonstrated using safety requirements of an adaptive cruise control (ACC) system.The EST approach can easily be integrated into an overall software test strategy which combines different test design techniques with specific test objectives.},

@article{Gross2000,
	Abstract = {Software architecture design approaches typically treat architecture as an abstraction of the implemented system. However, doing so means that the concepts, languages, notations, and tools for architecture are much more closely related to those of detailed design and implementation than to those of software requirements. Thus the gap between requirements and architecture represents a paradigm shift, while that between architecture and detailed design does not. Global Analysis, which is part of the Siemens Four Views architecture design approach, is a set of activities that serves to reduce the magnitude of this gap by guiding the architecture design process, capturing design rationale, and supporting traceability between requirements and architecture. In this paper Global Analysis is re-examined in light of five years of teaching it, reflecting on it, comparing it to other approaches, and examining how it was applied in four new systems. This experience confirms the value of the Global Analysis activities and the importance of capturing its results. In some cases the benefit went beyond that envisioned, and in other cases Global Analysis was not applied as expected. Because the templates that are provided for Global Analysis results have such a strong influence on how the activities were performed, this will be the focus of future changes},

	Abstract = {Research in metaheuristics for combinatorial optimization problems has lately experienced a noteworthy shift towards the hybridization of metaheuristics with other techniques for optimization. At the same time, the focus of research has changed from being rather algorithm-oriented to being more problem-oriented. Nowadays the focus is on solving the problem at hand in the best way possible, rather than promoting a certain metaheuristic. This has led to an enormously fruitful cross-fertilization of different areas of optimization. This cross-fertilization is documented by a multitude of powerful hybrid algorithms that were obtained by combining components from several different optimization techniques. Hereby, hybridization is not restricted to the combination of different metaheuristics but includes, for example, the combination of exact algorithms and metaheuristics. In this work we provide a survey of some of the most important lines of hybridization. The literature review is accompanied by the presentation of illustrative examples. {\copyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {The goal of a load test is to uncover functional and per- formance problems of a system under load. Performance problems refer to the situations where a system suffers from unexpectedly high response time or low throughput. It is difficult to detect performance problems in a load test due to the absence of formally-defined performance objectives and the large amount of data that must be examined. In this paper, we present an approach which automati- cally analyzes the execution logs of a load test for perfor- mance problems. We first derive the system's performance baseline from previous runs. Then we perform an in-depth performance comparison against the derived performance baseline. Case studies show that our approach produces few false alarms (with a precision of 77\%) and scales well to large industrial systems.},

	Abstract = {Search-based software testing is the application of metaheuristic search techniques to generate software tests. The test adequacy criterion is transformed into a fitness function and a set of solutions in the search space are evaluated with respect to the fitness function using a metaheuristic search technique. The application of metaheuristic search techniques for testing is promising due to the fact that exhaustive testing is infeasible considering the size and complexity of software under test. Search-based software testing has been applied across the spectrum of test case design methods; this includes white-box (structural), black-box (functional) and grey-box (combination of structural and functional) testing. In addition, metaheuristic search techniques have also been applied to test non-functional properties. The overall objective of undertaking this systematic review is to examine existing work into non-functional search-based software testing (NFSBST). We are interested in types of non-functional testing targeted using metaheuristic search techniques, different fitness functions used in different types of search-based non-functional testing and challenges in the application of these techniques. The systematic review is based on a comprehensive set of 35 articles obtained after a multi-stage selection process and have been published in the time span 1996-2007. The results of the review show that metaheuristic search techniques have been applied for non-functional testing of execution time, quality of service, security, usability and safety. A variety of metaheuristic search techniques are found to be applicable for non-functional testing including simulated annealing, tabu search, genetic algorithms, ant colony methods, grammatical evolution, genetic programming (and its variants including linear genetic programming) and swarm intelligence methods. The review reports on different fitness functions used to guide the search for each of the categories of execution time, safety, usability, quality of service and security; along with a discussion of possible challenges in the application of metaheuristic search techniques. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Wegener1997,
	Abstract = {The development of real-time systems is an essential industrial activity whose importance is increasing. The most important analytical method to assure the quality of real-time systems is dynamic testing. Testing is the only method which examines the actual run-time behaviour of real-time software, based on an execution in the real application environment. Dynamic aspects like the duration of computations, the memory actually needed, or the synchronization of parallel processes are of major importance for the correct function of real-time systems and have to be tested. A comprehensive investigation of existing software test methods shows that they mostly concentrate on testing for functional correctness. They are not suited for an examination of temporal correctness which is essential to real-time systems. Very small systems show a wide range of different execution times. Therefore, existing test procedures must be supplemented by new methods, which concentrate on determining whether the system violates its specified timing constraints. In general, this means that outputs are produced too early or their computation takes too long. The task of the tester is to find the inputs with the longest or shortest execution times to check whether they produce a temporal error. If the search for such inputs is interpreted as a problem of optimization, genetic algorithms can be used to find the inputs with the longest or shortest execution times automatically. The fitness function is the execution time measured in processor cycles. Experiments using genetic algorithms on a number of programs with up to 1511 LOC and 843 integer input parameters have successfully identified new longer and shorter paths than had been found using random testing or systematic testing. Genetic algorithms are able therefore to check large programs and they show considerable promise in establishing the validity of the temporal behaviour of real-time software.},

	Abstract = {In this work we are studying possibilities to test software using genetic algorithm search. The idea is to produce test cases in order to find problematic situations like processing time extremes. The proposed test method comes under the heading of automated dynamic stress testing. Keywords: genetic algorithms, software engineering, dynamic stress testing 1 Introduction Real-time software is increasingly applied to products in which failure may have severe consequences, thus the requirements for correctness and reliability are getting higher, too. In very reliable sequential programs, the rate of errors should be less than 10 errors/1000 lines of code, to avoid functional failure. Achieving this level is very labourious, because the amount of program testing work grows exponentially with code size. Testing software manually is slow, expensive and demands inventiveness. Automated testing can reduce both the time and costs needed for performing tests. Exhaustive test data generation is...},

	Abstract = {This survey investigates search-based approaches to software design. The basics of the most popular meta-heuristic algorithms are presented as background to the search-based viewpoint. Software design is considered from a wide viewpoint, including topics that can also be categorized as software maintenance or re-engineering. Search-based approaches have been used in research from the high architecture design level to software clustering and finally software refactoring. Enhancing and predicting software quality with search-based methods is also taken into account as a part of the design process. The background for the underlying software engineering problems is discussed, after which search-based approaches are presented. Summarizing remarks and tables collecting the fundamental issues of approaches for each type of problem are given. The choices regarding critical decisions, such as representation and fitness function, when used in meta-heuristic search algorithms, are emphasized and discussed in detail. Ideas for future research directions are also given. {\copyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Experimental results from a testbed show that TAN models involving small subsets of metrics capture patterns of performance behavior in a way that is accurate and yields insights into the causes of observed performance effects. TANs are extremely efficient to represent and evaluate, and they have interpretability properties that make them excellent candidates for automated diagnosis and control. We explore the use of TAN models for offline forensic diagnosis, and in a limited online setting for performance forecasting with stable workloads.},

built-in self-test and recovery mechanisms in major system components
(switches) contributed to software dependability and are significant
design features in the PSTN. The network's high dependability indicates
that the trade-off between dependability gains and complexity introduced
by built-in self-test and recovery mechanisms can be positive. Likewise,
the tradeoff between complex interactions and the loose coupling of
system components has been positive, permitting quick human intervention
in most system failures and resulting in an extremely reliable system

The problem consists of automatically creating a set of input data to test a program. This is a fundamental step in software development and a time consuming task in existing software companies. Canonical sequential EAs have been used in the past for this task. We explore here the use of parallel EAs. Evidence of greater efficiency, larger diversity maintenance, additional availability of memory/CPU, and multi-solution capabilities of the parallel approach, reinforce the importance of the advances in research with these algorithms. We describe in this work how canonical genetic algorithms (GAs) and evolutionary strategies (ESs) can help in software testing, and what the advantages are (if any) of using decentralized populations in these techniques. In addition, we study the influence of some parameters of the proposed test data generator in the results. For the experiments we use a large benchmark composed of twelve programs that includes fundamental algorithms in computer science. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

However, despite the large number of recent studies on the applicability of different search-based optimization approaches, there has been very little theoretical analysis of the types of testing problem for which these techniques are well suited. There are also few empirical studies that present results for larger programs. This paper presents a theoretical exploration of the most widely studied approach, the global search technique embodied by Genetic Algorithms. It also presents results from a large empirical study that compares the behavior of both global and local search-based optimization on real-world programs. The results of this study reveal that cases exist of test data generation problem that suit each algorithm, thereby suggesting that a hybrid global-local search (a Memetic Algorithm) may be appropriate. The paper presents a Memetic Algorithm along with further empirical results studying its performance.},

abstract = {Penetration testing is widely used to help ensure the security of web applications. Using penetration testing, testers discover vulnerabilities by simulating attacks on a target web application. To do this efﬁciently, testers rely on automated techniques that gather input vector information about the target web application and analyze the application's responses to determine whether an attack was successful. Techniques for performing these steps are often incomplete, which can leave parts of the web application untested and vulnerabilities undiscovered. This paper proposes a new approach to penetration testing that addresses the limitations of current techniques. The approach incorporates two recently developed analysis techniques to improve input vector identiﬁcation and detect when attacks have been successful against a web application.

abstract = {The specification of workloads is required in order to evaluate performance characteristics of application systems using load testing and model-based performance prediction. Defining workload specifications that represent the real workload as accurately as possible is one of the biggest challenges in both areas. To overcome this challenge, this paper presents an approach that aims to automate the extraction and transformation of workload specifications for load testing and model-based performance prediction of session-based application systems. The approach (WESSBAS) comprises three main components. First, a system- and tool-agnostic domain-specific language (DSL) allows the layered modeling of workload specifications of session-based systems. Second, instances of this DSL are automatically extracted from recorded session logs of production systems. Third, these instances are transformed into executable workload specifications of load generation tools and model-based performance evaluation tools. We present transformations to the common load testing tool Apache JMeter and to the Palladio Component Model. Our approach is evaluated using the industry-standard benchmark SPECjEnterprise2010 and the World Cup 1998 access logs. Workload-specific characteristics (e.g., session lengths and arrival rates) and performance characteristics (e.g., response times and CPU utilizations) show that the extracted workloads match the measured workloads with high accuracy.},

In Reinforcement Learning, Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto provide a clear and simple account of the key ideas and algorithms of reinforcement learning. Their discussion ranges from the history of the field's intellectual foundations to the most recent developments and applications. The only necessary mathematical background is familiarity with elementary concepts of probability. The book is divided into three parts. Part I defines the reinforcement learning problem in terms of Markov decision processes. Part II provides basic solution methods: dynamic programming, Monte Carlo methods, and temporal-difference learning. Part III presents a unified view of the solution methods and incorporates artificial neural networks, eligibility traces, and planning; the two final chapters present case studies and consider the future of reinforcement learning.},

Further, the predictions may have long term effects through influencing the future state of the controlled system. Thus, time plays a special role. The goal in reinforcement learning is to develop efficient learning algorithms, as well as to understand the al- gorithms' merits and limitations. Reinforcement learning is of great interest because of the large number of practical applications that it can be used to address, ranging from problems in artificial intelligence to operations research or control engineering. In this book,we focus on those algorithms of reinforcement learning that build on the powerful theory of dynamic programming.We give a fairly comprehensive catalog of learning problems, describe the core ideas, note a large number of state of the art algorithms, followed by the discussion of their theoretical properties and limitations.},

Using penetration testing, testers discover vulnerabilities by simulating attacks on a target web application. To do this efﬁciently, testers rely on automated techniques that gather input vector information about the target web application and analyze the application's responses to determine whether an attack was successful. Techniques for performing these steps are often incomplete, which can leave parts of the web application untested and vulnerabilities undiscovered. This paper proposes a new approach to penetration testing that addresses the limitations of current techniques. The approach incorporates two recently developed analysis techniques to improve input vector identiﬁcation and detect when attacks have been successful against a web application.

A fundamental question of performance testing is how to select a manageable subset of the input data faster in order to automatically find performance bottlenecks in applications. We propose FOREPOST, a novel solution, for automatically finding performance bottlenecks in applications using black-box software testing. Our solution is an adaptive, feedback-directed learning testing system that learns rules from execution traces of applications. Theses rules are then used to automatically select test input data for performance testing. We hypothesize that FOREPOST can find more performance bottlenecks as compared to random testing. We have implemented our solution and applied it to a medium-size industrial application at a major insurance company and to two open-source applications. Performance bottlenecks were found automatically and confirmed by experienced testers and developers. We also thoroughly studied the factors (or independent variables) that impact the results of FOREPOST. {\&}copy; 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York},

	Abstract = {This is the second half of a two part series devoted to the tabu search metastrategy for optimization problems. Part I introduced the fundamental ideas of tabu search as an approach for guiding other heuristics to overcome the limitations of local optimality, both in a deterministic and a probabilistic framework. Part I also reported successful applications from a wide range of settings, in which tabu search frequently made it possible to obtain higher quality solutions than previously obtained with competing strategies, generally with less computational effort. Part II, in this issue, examines refinements and more advanced aspects of tabu search. Following a brief review of notation, Part II introduces new dynamic strategies for managing tabu lists, allowing fuller exploitation of underlying evaluation functions. In turn, the elements of staged search and structured move sets are characterized, which bear on the issue of finiteness. Three ways of applying tabu search to the solution of integer programming problems are then described, providing connections also to certain nonlinear programming applications. Finally, the paper concludes with a brief survey of new applications of tabu search that have occurred since the developments reported in Part I. Together with additional comparisons with other methods on a wide body of problems, these include results of parallel processing implementations and the use of tabu search in settings ranging from telecommunications to neural networks.},

@article{Wegener1998,
	Abstract = {Many industrial products are based on the use of embedded computer systems. Usually, these systems have to fulfil real-time requirements, and correct system functionality depends on their logical correctness as well as on their temporal correctness. in order to verify the temporal behavior of real-time systems, previous scientific work has, to a large extent, concentrated on static analysis techniques. Although these techniques offer the possibility of providing safe estimates of temporal behavior for certain cases, there are a number of cases in practice for which static analysis can not be easily applied. Furthermore, no commercial tools for timing analysis of real-world programs are available. Therefore, the developed systems have to be thoroughly tested in order to detect existing deficiencies in temporal behavior, as well as to strengthen the confidence in temporal correctness. An investigation of existing test methods shows that they mostly concentrate on testing for logical correctness. They are nor specialised in the examination of temporal correctness which is also essential to real-rime systems. For this reason, existing test procedures must be supplemented by new methods which concentrate on determining whether the system violates its specified timing constraints. Normally, a violation means that outputs are produced too early, or their computation takes too long. The task of the tester therefore is to find the input situations with the longest or shortest execution limes, in order to check whether they produce a temporal error. If the starch for such inputs is interpreted as a problem of optimization, evolutionary computation can be used to automatically find the inputs with the longest or shortest execution rimes. This automatic search for accurate test data by means of evolutionary computation is called evolutionary testing. Experiments using evolutionary testing on a number of programs with up to 1511 LOC and 5000 input parameters have successfully identified new longer and shorter execution times than had been found using other testing techniques. Evolutionary testing, therefore, seems to be a promising approach for the verification of timing constraints. A combination of evolutionary testing and systematic testing offers further opportunities to improve the test quality, and could lead to an effective test strategy for real-time systems.},

abstract = {It is often assumed that software testing is based on clearly defined requirements and software development standards. However, testing is typically performed against changing, and sometimes inaccurate, requirements. The third edition of a bestseller, Software Testing and Continuous Quality Improvement, Third Edition provides a continuous quality framework for the software testing process within traditionally structured and unstructured environments. This framework aids in creating meaningful test cases for systems with evolving requirements. This completely revised reference provides a comprehensive look at software testing as part of the project management process, emphasizing testing and quality goals early on in development. Building on the success of previous editions, the text explains testing in a Service Orientated Architecture (SOA) environment, the building blocks of a Testing Center of Excellence (COE), and how to test in an agile development. Fully updated, the sections on test effort estimation provide greater emphasis on testing metrics. The book also examines all aspects of functional testing and looks at the relation between changing business strategies and changes to applications in development. Includes New Chapters on Process, Application, and Organizational Metrics All IT organizations face software testing issues, but most are unprepared to manage them. Software Testing and Continuous Quality Improvement, Third Editionis enhanced with an up-to-date listing of free software tools and a question-and-answer checklist for choosing the best tools for your organization. It equips you with everything you need to effectively address testing issues in the most beneficial way for your business.},

abstract = {AUTOSAR multicore RTOS is a safety-critical concurrent system, for which high quality is required. A conformance test is important to ensure the quality of the software, but the conventional test is low in coverage and high in cost. In this paper, we present a formal model-based test for multicore RTOS that supports AUTOSAR specifications. First, we developed a formal model. With the model, we developed a test case generator, from which an entire test suite can be extracted. Moreover, we proposed a test program generator, with which optimal executable test programs can be generated fully automatically. Both of the generators are assisted with model checking on the formal model. Bug analysis also becomes easy. Our method demonstrated its advantage over conventional testing by finding 33 test cases for three system service calls, whereas a conventional test carried out by a development team found only 10 test cases. Our method can improve the coverage of the test, clearly saving in cost and development time. It is expected to significantly improve the testing of the AUTOSAR multicore RTOS.},

abstract = {Testing activities play an important role in order to obtain high quality software products. These activities become more important when considering critical software, for instance, space application software. Nowadays, there is an extensive collaboration among space institutions. So, it is more than natural to expect distributed development of software and software testing activities. Therefore, a collaborative tool hosted on the internet becomes quite useful. In this respect, WEB-PerformCharts 2.0 tool discussed in this paper moves in this direction. The tool focuses on supporting a single aspect of distributed software development: the activity of generating test cases via web. Moreover, it allows model-based test case generation by means of formal methods (formal languages statecharts and FSM) which are considered state of the art in software development. WEB-PerformCharts 2.0 can be used to generate test cases for any kind of reactive systems modelled in statecharts or FSM. We present three case studies in different application domains to demonstrate the feasibility of our tool. Copyright {\&}copy; 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

Our method involves the transformation of FBD programs with timed annotations into timed automata models which are used to automatically generate test suites. Specifically we demonstrate how to use model transformation for formalization and modelchecking of FBD programs using the UPPAAL tool. Many benefits emerge from this method, including the ability to automatically generate test suites from a formal model in order to ensure compliance to strict quality requirements including unit testing and specific coverage measurements.

However, this approach is not always optimal in practice due to the required time and memory, or even not feasible due to the state explosion problem of model checking. A way to mitigate these limitations consists in decomposing a system model into suitable subsystem models separately analyzable. In this paper, we show a technique to decompose a system model into subsystems by exploiting the model variables dependency, and then we propose a test generation approach which builds tests for the single subsystems and combines them later in order to obtain tests for the system as a whole. Such approach mitigates the exponential increase of the test generation time and memory consumption, and, compared with the same model-based test generation technique applied to the whole system, shows to be more efficient. We prove that, although not complete, the approach is sound. {\&}copy; 2015 ACM.},

abstract = {Test and validation of autonomous mechatronic systems is a major challenge. Due to more complex tasks as well as dynamic environments, existing test and validation methods are reaching their limits. The complexity and diversity of their elements and interrelations of these as well as interrelations with environmental elements have to be handled because established methods do not consider the characteristics of autonomous mechatronic systems. Therefore Systems Engineering seems to be a proper solution. Based on system thinking an approach for analyzing autonomous mechatronic systems will be developed. For this purpose a procedure for model development will be aligned with the robot's system model. This system model combines hardware and software elements, analyzes their interrelations and prepares a later test and validation. With the help of this new system model, which decomposes to the hardware and software level, new test and validation methods can be developed. {\&}copy; 2015 IEEE.},

abstract = {Robotic code needs to be verified to ensure its safety and functional correctness, especially when the robot is interacting with people. Testing real code in simulation is a viable option. However, generating tests that cover rare scenarios, as well as exercising most of the code, is a challenge amplified by the complexity of the interactions between the environment and the software. Model-based test generation methods can automate otherwise manual processes and facilitate reaching rare scenarios during testing. In this paper, we compare using Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents as models for test generation with more conventional automata-based techniques that exploit model checking, in terms of practicality, performance, transferability to different scenarios, and exploration (`coverage'), through two case studies: a cooperative manufacturing task, and a home care scenario. The results highlight the advantages of using BDI agents for test generation. BDI agents naturally emulate the agency present in Human-Robot Interactions (HRIs), and are thus more expressive than automata. The performance of the BDI-based test generation is at least as high, and the achieved coverage is higher or equivalent, compared to test generation based on model checking automata.},

@article{Gay2016,
abstract = {The oracle—an arbiter of correctness of the system under test (SUT)—is a major component of the testing process. Specifying oracles is particularly challenging for real-time embedded systems, where small changes in time or sensor inputs may cause large differences in behavior. Behavioral models of such systems, often built for analysis and simulation purposes, are naturally appealing for reuse as oracles. However, these models typically provide an idealized view of the system. Even when given the same inputs, the model's behavior can frequently be at variance with some acceptable behavior of the SUT executing on a real platform. We therefore propose steering the model when used as an oracle, to admit an expanded set of behaviors when judging the SUT's adherence to its requirements. On detecting a behavioral difference, the model is backtracked and then searched for a new state that satisfies certain constraints and minimizes a dissimilarity metric. The goal is to allow non-deterministic, but bounded, behavior differences while preventing future mismatches, by guiding the oracle—within limits—to match the execution of the SUT. Early experimental results show that steering significantly increases SUT-oracle conformance with minimal masking of real faults and, thus, has significant potential for reducing development costs.},

abstract = {Elastic computing systems can dynamically scale to continuously and cost-effectively provide their required Quality of Service in face of time-varying workloads, and they are usually implemented in the cloud. Despite their wide-spread adoption by industry, a formal definition of elasticity and suitable procedures for its assessment and verification are still missing. Both academia and industry are trying to adapt established testing procedures for functional and non-functional properties, with limited effectiveness with respect to elasticity. In this paper we propose a new methodology to automatically generate test-suites for testing the elastic properties of systems. Elasticity, plasticity, and oscillations are first formalized through a convenient behavioral abstraction of the elastic system and then used to drive an iterative test suite refinement process. The outcomes of our approach are a test suite tailored to the violation of elasticity properties and a human-readable abstraction of the system behavior to further support diagnosis and fix.},

abstract = {The Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) paradigm is giving rise to a new generation of applications built by dynamically composing loosely coupled autonomous services. Clients (i.e., software agents acting on behalf of human users or service providers) implementing such complex applications typically search and integrate services on the basis of their functional requirements and of their trust in the service suppliers. A major issue in this scenario relates to the definition of an assurance technique allowing clients to select services on the basis of their nonfunctional requirements and increasing their confidence that the selected services will satisfy such requirements. In this article, we first present an assurance solution that focuses on security and supports a test-based security certification scheme for Web services. The certification scheme is driven by the security properties to be certified and relies upon a formal definition of the service model. The evidence supporting a certified property is computed using a model-based testing approach that, starting from the service model, automatically generates the test cases to be used in the service certification. We also define a set of indexes and metrics that evaluate the assurance level and the quality of the certification process. Finally, we present our evaluation toolkit and experimental results obtained applying our certification solution to a financial service implementing the Interactive Financial eXchange (IFX) standard.},

[Method] We are conducting experimental studies to provide evidence about the required effort to use CR-based tools and MBT tools. In this paper, we present our first results, evaluating the effort (time spent) when using LoadRunner and Visual Studio CR-based tools, and the PLeTsPerf MBT tool to create performance test scripts and scenarios to test Web applications, in the context of a collaboration project between Software Engineering Research Center at PUCRS and a technological laboratory of a global IT company. [Results] Our results indicate that, for simple testing tasks, the effort of using a CR-based tool was lower than using an MBT tool, but as the testing complexity increases tasks, the advantage of using MBT grows significantly.

To automate generation and selection of$\backslash$ntest cases, model-based testing techniques have been$\backslash$nsuggested. In this thesis two central problems in$\backslash$nmodel-based testing are addressed: the problem of$\backslash$nhow to formally specify coverage criteria, and the$\backslash$nproblem of how to generate a test suite from a$\backslash$nformal timed system model, such that the test suite$\backslash$nsatisfies a given coverage criterion. We use model$\backslash$nchecking techniques to explore the state-space of a$\backslash$nmodel until a set of traces is found that together$\backslash$nsatisfy the coverage criterion. A key observation is$\backslash$nthat a coverage criterion can be viewed as$\backslash$nconsisting of a set of items, which we call coverage$\backslash$nitems. Each coverage item can be treated as a$\backslash$nseparate reachability problem. Based on our view$\backslash$nof coverage items we define a language, in the form$\backslash$nof parameterized observer automata, to formally$\backslash$ndescribe coverage criteria.

These algorithms have been used successfully to perform load testing for several real industrial software systems. Experience generating test suites for five such systems is presented. Early experience with the algorithms indicate that they are highly effective at detecting subtle faults that would have been likely to be missed if load testing had been done in the more traditional way, using hand-crafted test cases. A domain-based reliability measure is applied to systems after the load testing algorithms have been used to generate test data. Data are presented for the same five industrial telecommunications systems in order to track the reliability as a function of the degree of system degradation experienced},

abstract = {There is an abundance of testing styles in the discipline of software engineering today. Over the last few decades, many of these have come to be used and adopted by the industry as solutions to address the increasing demand for assuring software quality. Since 1990 or so, perhaps as an outcome of the popularization of object orientation and models in software engineering, there has been a growth in black-box testing techniques that are collectively dubbed model-based testing. Model-based testing (MBT) is a general term that signifies an approach that bases common testing tasks such as test case generation and test result evaluation [see Jorgensen (1995) for some of these basic terms and concepts] on a model of the application under test.This generic definition is probably the least general statement that can be made about MBT. One of the striking issues about MBT is the nonstandard lingo that reflects a diversity of philosophies and models. Another issue that one will eventually realize in studying this set of techniques is that the models and techniques have yet to travel the long course to maturity. Disregarding these concerns, model-based techniques have gained the attention of practitioners and theoreticians alike. The wealth of published work portraying case studies in both academic and industrial settings is a sign of the newfound interest in this youthful branch of testing.Model-based techniques have substantial appeal. The first sign of potential are studies showing that testing a variety of applications has been met with success when MBT was employed. This article discussed what a model is and gives some models that have been useful for testing. Information given or choosing a module, building it, and testing it, The present and future status of model-based software testing is detailed.},

@article{MarkUtting2012,
abstract = {Penetration testing is widely used to help ensure the security of web applications. Using penetration testing, testers discover vulnerabilities by simulating attacks on a target web application. To do this efﬁciently, testers rely on automated techniques that gather input vector information about the target web application and analyze the application's responses to determine whether an attack was successful. Techniques for performing these steps are often incomplete, which can leave parts of the web application untested and vulnerabilities undiscovered. This paper proposes a new approach to penetration testing that addresses the limitations of current techniques. The approach incorporates two recently developed analysis techniques to improve input vector identiﬁcation and detect when attacks have been successful against a web application. This paper compares the proposed approach against two popular penetration testing tools for a suite of web applications with known and unknown vulnerabilities. The evaluation results show that the proposed approach performs a more thorough penetration testing and leads to the discovery of more vulnerabilities than both the tools.},

abstract = {A Web Service is commonly not an independent software entity, but plays a role in some business process. Hence, it depends on the services provided by external Web Services, to provide its own service. While developing and testing a Web Service, such external services are not always available, or their usage comes along with unwanted side effects like, e.g., utilization fees or database modifications. We present a model-based approach to generate stubs for Web Services which respect both an extra-functional contract expressed via a Service Level Agree- ment (SLA), and a functional contract modeled via a state machine. These stubs allow a developer to set up a testbed over the target plat- form, in which the extra-functional and functional behavior of a Web Service under development can be tested before its publication.},

In this paper, we undertake a systematic mapping study to present a broad review of primary studies on the application of search-based optimization techniques to non-functional testing. The motivation is to identify the evidence available on the topic and to identify gaps in the application of search-based optimization techniques to different types of non-functional testing. The study is based on a comprehensive set of 35 papers obtained after using a multi-stage selection criteria and are published in workshops, conferences and journals in the time span 1996-2007. We conclude that the search-based software testing community needs to do more and broader studies on non-functional search-based software testing (NFSBST) and the results from our systematic map can help direct such efforts.},

abstract = {Accurate web application performance testing relies on the use of loading tests based on a realistic client behaviour load model. Unfortunately developing such load models and associated test plans and scripts is tedious and error-prone with most existing web performance testing tools providing limited client load modelling capabilities. We describe a new approach and toolset that we have developed, MaramaMTE+, which improves the ability to model realistic web client load behaviour, automatically generates complex web application testing plans and scripts, and integrates load behaviour modelling with a generic performance engineering tool. MaramaMTE+ uses a stochastic form chart as its client loading model. A 3rd party web crawler application extracts structural information from a target web site, aggregating the collected data into a crawler database that is then used for form chart model generation. The performance engineer then augments this synthesized form probabilities. Realistic web loading tests for a 3rd party web load testing tool are then automatically generated from this resultant stochastic form chart client load model. We chart with client loading describe the development of our MaramaMTE+ environment, example usage of the tool, and compare and contrast the results obtained from our generated performance load tests against hand-built 3rd party tool load tests.},

abstract = {New versions of existing large-scale web services such as Passport.comcopy have to go through rigorous performance evaluations in order to ensure a high degree of availability. Performance testing (such as benchmarking, scalability, and capacity tests) of large-scale stateful systems in managed test environments has many different challenges, mainly related to the reproducibility of production conditions in live data centers. One of these challenges is creating a dataset in a test environment that mimics the actual dataset in production. Other challenges involve the characterization of load patterns in production based on log analysis and proper load simulation via reutilization of data from the existing dataset. The intent of this paper is to describe practical approaches to address some of the aforementioned challenges through the use of various novel techniques. For example, this paper discusses data sanitization, which is the alteration of large datasets in a controlled manner to obfuscate sensitive information, preserving data integrity, relationships, and data equivalence classes. This paper also provides techniques for load pattern characterization via the application of Markov chains to custom and generic logs, as well as general guidelines for the development of cache-based load simulation tools tailored for the performance evaluation of stateful systems.},
